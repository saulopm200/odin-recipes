    <ul>
        <li>1 (10 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons seasoned salt</li>
        <li>2 Â½ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 (12 fluid ounce) cans cola-flavored carbonated beverage</li>
        <li>1 medium apple, quartered</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, quartered</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups hickory wood chips, or more as needed (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a smoker to 225 to 250 degrees F (110 to 120 degrees C)</li>
            <li>Rinse turkey under cold water, and pat dry.</li>
            <li>Rub crushed garlic over the outside of the turkey, and sprinkle with seasoned salt. Transfer to a disposable roasting pan.</li>
            <li>Fill the turkey cavity with butter, cola, apple, onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cover turkey loosely with foil.</li>
            <li>Add wood chips to the smoker according to the manufacturer's directions. Place the roasting pan in the preheated smoker. Smoke the turkey, basting every 1 to 2 hours with juices from the bottom of the roasting pan, for 5 hours.</li>
            <li>Add more wood chips if desired. Continue smoking and basting, until turkey is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 5 more hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 180 degrees F (80 degrees C).</li>
